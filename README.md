# Javascript Array Methods Recreations

This project is a work-in-progress building and testing series of functions that imitate the established behaviours of Javascript array methods using [Joe Walnes's unit testing library](https://github.com/joewalnes/jstinytest). Taking the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, each test makes sure the re-created function satisfies the requirements of the corresponding native JS method.

## List of methods tested (to be updated)
Iterators
``` console
Array.prototype.forEach()
Array.prototype.filter()
Array.prototype.map()
Array.prototype.reduce()
Array.prototype.find()
Array.prototype.findIndex()
```
